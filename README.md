# This Python script, which uses pandas, processes daily weather data in a long, time-series format. 
# It extracts minimum, maximum, and precipitation values from 3 different excel files, then reformats them into a wider format compatible with the MapShed hydrological model. 
# This includes converting millimeters to inches and Celsius to Fahrenheit and saves new dataframe to a csv file, as required by the model.
